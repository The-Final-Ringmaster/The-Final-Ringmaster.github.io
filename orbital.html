    Currently <b>not</b> in use
    Reason:   <b>N/A</b>

    From time to time, I need to swiftly and cleanly get rid of something.
    I ran into this issue one too many times, and eventually caved in and
    built an Array of twenty-seven, super-precise orbital laser weapons.

    This Array was Medi-Pultâ„¢ed into orbit in mid-2021 and since then has
    been used to dispose of 23 objects/locations. Combined, these cannons
    can completely evaporate the intended object with almost no signs of
    interference. All that might remain is burn marks nearby and maybe a
    bit of a bad smell depending on the object remotely incinerated.

<div class="comment">    // This array has been private and only available to myself...
    //  <i>...up until now!</i>

    // You can now submit requests to use the Array through any
    // communications platform I'm on. No reason required, no questions
    // asked: Just ask me, and if it's not in use, <i>it will be done</i>.</div>

    A proper submittion system will be implemented sometime in the future.
