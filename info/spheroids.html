  <h2>Spheroids: A summary</h2>
  <img class="fw" src="spheroids.png">
  <p><em>(In the above diagram, solid lines represent links and dashed lines represent orbits in the 7th and 8th spatial dimensions)</em></p>
  <p>Spheroids are the harbours of intelligence: they are the only places in the universe where self-aware life can occur. There is a predicted total of 8 Spheroids, and currently 5 have been discovered. These five are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spheroid 2: Neptune</li>
    <li>Spheroid 3: Kepler 22b</li>
    <li>Spheroid 4: Earth</li>
    <li>Spheroid 7: Unport (the location of my dwelling)</li>
    <li>Spheroid 8: Mars</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the diagram, you can see that the Spheroids are divided in three categories, by the space between them and the amount of links there are.</p>
  <p><b>Category 1</b> only contains Spheroid 1, theorised to be the centric Spheroid from which all others are derived. It is linked to all prime numbered Spheroids, by coincidence or other means.</p>
  <p><b>Category 2</b> contains Spheroids 2-4. They each have two links. The space between them and Spheroid 1 is titled the Transportational Plane, due to the activity inside it. The orbit on which they sit in the 7th and 8th spatial dimensions is called the Bitransportational Boundary.</p>
  <p><b>Category 3</b> contains Spheroids 5-8. They each have one link to either a Spheroid on the Bitransportational Boundary or Spheroid 1. The space between them and the Bitransportational Boundary is titled the Isoplane due to the rarity of any activity between them and other Spheroids.</p>
  <p>It is predicted not only that Spheroid 1 is the origin of all other Spheroids, but also Magenta, Apioforms (and in turn ｂｅｅｈｕｍａｎs), the Malbolge esoteric programming language and other oddities that seem to partially or completely defy standard quantaspheric physics.</p>
  <p>Some theorise that more Spheroids can exist given the right conditions in the 6th dimension. However, due to unknown reasons, any information and evidence about how anyone has come to this conclusion is illegible to anyone who has not themselves independently come to such a conclusion.</p><iframe height="50" src="https://george.gh0.pw/embed.cgi?fragment&c_bg=%23550055&c_fg=white&c_links=ffaaff&c_george=%2300aaff" style="border:none;width:100%"></iframe>
