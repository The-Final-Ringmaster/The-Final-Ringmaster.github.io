<h2><a name="p-1">Part -1: Introduction</a></h2>

FrostAssembly, more commonly referred to
as FAsm, is a very obfuscated programming
language that I (u/ringMaster1111) have
created in Python. It is stack-based and
uses Reverse Polish Notation. It was
originally inspired by Forth, but when
I saw the increasingly long syntax for if
statements and functions, I decided to go
my own way.
FAsm has three storage devices:
 - Stack       <a href="#p0">Part 0</a>
 - Accumulator <a href="#p2a">Part 2</a>
 - Spare       <a href="#p2b">Part 2</a>
Read to find out more.


<h2><a name="p0">Part 0: The Basics</a></h2>

FAsm uses Reverse Polish Notation, meaning
that the Operands go before the Operator.
For example, writing 5 add 3 would look like
this:
 | 5 3 +

FAsm uses a stack as it's primary form of
data storage. A stack has two primary
operations; PUSH and POP. Performing a
PUSH will add an item to the end of the
stack. Performing a POP will return the
last PUSHed item, and remove that item
from the stack.

E. G.
Stack:
PUSH 5
Stack: 5
PUSH 3
Stack: 5, 3
POP
Stack: 5

To push a value to the stack in FAsm,
you simply type the number. For example,
pushing 5 would simply require you to
type 5. This is where Reverse Polish
Notation comes in. An example piece
of code would be:
 | 5 3 +

First, the code PUSHes 5 to the stack.
Next,  the code PUSHes 3 to the stack
Finally, the plus symbol.
Internally, plus will POP two values
from the stack, add them together and
PUSH the result back.
As another example,
 | 10 4 +

Is equal to 10+4.

You may have noticed that the previous
code simply operates on values, but
has no user inclusion. For this, we have
the operators:
 - "."
 - ","

"." will display a value as a number.
"," will convert the value to ASCII
and then display the resulting character.
 | 65 .
Would display the number 65, while
 | 65 ,
Would display the character "A".

This still only allows for displaying
information, and not letting the user
do something. For this, we have the
operator
 | ;
This operator takes user input, takes
the first character and converts it
to it's ASCII number, which is pushed
to stack.

 | ; 1 + ,
The above programs takes input, and
then gives the next ASCII character.
For example, "A" would return "B"
and "1" would return "2".

Let's end on the "x" operator. It
simply deletes the top value in
stack.


<h2><a name="p1">Part 1: Making decisions</a></h2>

Currently, the path that our program takes
is completely predefined and will always
be the same. Let's change that. Introducing
the logic operators:
 - "="
 - ">"
 - "<"
 - "?"
 - "!"

Let's start with "?". This is your main
crutch when it comes to making decisions.
If the latest stack value is not equal to
zero, it will execute the following
instruction. Otherwise, both the "?" and the
next instruction are ignored. Combined with
some of the techniques described in the
following parts, the "?" operator is a
truly powerful tool.

Next, let's cover "!". If the "?" operator
was this:
if (POP!=0) {code}
Then the "!" operator would be:
if (POP==0) {code}

Of course, we need a method of making
checks before using "?" or "!". This is
the purpose of the operators "=",">" &
"<".

"=" compares the previous two stack values.
If they are equal, it PUSHes 1 to stack.
Otherwise, it PUSHes 0.

">" compares just like "=".
If the first value is greater than the
second, it PUSHes 1. Otherwise, it
PUSHes 0.

"<" is exactly the same as ">", except
the first value has to be <em>less</em> than
the second.

Using these, comparisons are easy to implement.

 | ; 64 > ? 66 ? ,
The above program, although pretty useless,
demonstrates the decision operators. First,
it takes user input. Next, it makes a
greater-than check. Then, if the check
succeeded, the code displays the letter "B".

Overall, It simply checks if the first letter
of the input is, well, a letter.

That's about it for basic decision making.


<h2><a name="p2">Part 2: More Data</a></h2>

As mentioned in <a href="#p-1">Part -1</a>, the stack is not the
only form of storage in FAsm. There are two
other containers for your data. These are:
 - <a href="#p2a">The Accumulator</a>
 - <a href="#p2b">The Spare</a>


<h3><a name="p2a">The Accumulator</a></h3>

The accumulator is the most versatile
alternative form of storage. There are two
operators for using the accumulator:
 - "a"
 - "p"
 - "l"

The "p" operator is what you use to change
the contents of the accumulator. It is similar
to a POP, except the result from the stack is
put into the accumulator.

The "a" operator simply PUSHes the value of
the accummulator to stack. Keep in mind that
when performing this, the accumulator does
not get emptied. This allows for duplication:
 | 6 p a a
The above code will duplicate six and there
will be two copies of it in the end.

The "l" operator is a special one. It enables
what's known as Accumulator Mode. This changes
the states of the below operators:
 - "?"
 - "!"
 - "."
 - ","

The decision operators, when in Accumulator Mode,
check for the value of the accumulator and not
for the latest value in stack.

The display operators, when in Accumulator Mode,
display the value in the accumulator and not in
the stack.

This allows you to store the results of a check
in the accumulator, allowing you to freely push
and pull values from stack in the decision
operators without affecting their state.

<h3><a name="p2b">The Spare</a></h3>

The spare is intended for use in much smaller
operations. You only have one operator for
controlling the spare:
 | s

The "s" operator functions as two. When the
spare is empty, which it is by default, it
will operate like the "p" operator but pulls
the value into the spare.
If the spare already contains data, the "s"
operator will PUSH it's value back on top
of the stack and empty the spare itself.

This allows for things such as safe duplication,
which preserves the accumulators original value:
 | 12 p  6  a s  p a a  s p
The above program duplicates the number 6, yet
at the end, the accumulator value of 12 is still
retained.


<h2><a name="p3">Part 3: Labels and Subroutines</a></h2>

you may have noticed that we have not yet described
any way to make loops or functions. This part will
introduce you to labels, jumps and returns.

The new operators we will use here are:
 - "_%"
 - ":%"
 - "f%"

Let's start with the "_" operator.

This operator is used to make labels that you can
jump to from any part of your code. Labels by
themselves are ignored in code. The following is
the syntax for making a new label:
 | _labelname
The length of the label is not defined. It can be
anything you want.

Let's move on to ":".

This operator jumps to a label. The location of
this label does not matter, it simply needs to be
in the document.
 | 0 _loop 1 + 5 = p x l ? :loop
The above program will increment the counter until
it is equal to 5.

Finally, let's cover "f".

This operator is very similar to the ":" operator,
but with one key difference. When jumping to a label,
this operator will also save a program location to
return to when the "r" operator is called.
Be careful though: If you don't structure your function
definitions right, errors will happen. As an example:
 | 65 fd 66 fd 67 fd _d , x r
will bring up an error due to the fact that when it is
done displaying "ABC", it will attempt to execute _d
again due to the fact that it is next in the program.
I recommend fixing it like so:
 | 65 fd 66 fd 67 fd :end _d , x r _end
Put all of your functions between ":end" and "_end".
This will make it so that when the program eventually
reaches the functions, it will jump straight to the end.


<h2><a name="pE">Epilogue</a></h2>

That about covers it for the important stuff. I worked
pretty hard on the language and am tired, so updates
won't be coming for a while.

I think you can do quite a lot with this, especially
considering languages that can compile to FAsm.
For example, here is a basic Command Line:
 :main

 _c = p x r
 _d , x r

 _main ;
 65 fc l ? :pA
 66 fc l ? :pB
 :error

 _pA 67 fd :main
 _pB 68 fd :main
 _error 69 fd 82 fd 82 fd 79 fd 82 fd :main
It only has two commands, "A" and "B", which
display "C" and "D" respectively. However, I bet
that someone would be able to make something more
complicated.

Also, if you want to do something more complicated
with the language, study the "fasmlib.py" file,
specifically the two arguments apart from "source"
and what the function does with them. That should
give you what you're looking for :P
